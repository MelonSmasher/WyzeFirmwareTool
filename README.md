# Wyze Firmware Tool

A simple tool to handle some mundane tasks that are required when modifying Wyze camera firmware.

## What does it do?

This tool downloads, unpacks, mods, and repacks Wyze firmware files.

## Camera Support

* Wyze Cam v2

I only have a Wyze Cam v2 to mess around with. If you have a device you're willing to potentially brick feel free to
mess around with this.

## Mods

Below are the mods this tool will enable

* The `-u` / `--usb-ethernet` switch enables USB ethernet adapter support for ASIX based adapters such
  as [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0863YJB8W/).
* The `-d` / `--disable-wlan` switch disables wireless on the camera. This switch implies the `-u` switch and enables
  USB ethernet.
* The `-t` / `--telnet-server` switch enables a persistent telnet server on the camera. This option requires that you
  set a root password, you'll be prompted.
* Custom user supplied mods. The tool will pause to allow you to make any custom modifications tht you'd like. The tool
  will resume when any key is pressed in the terminal. This step can be skipped with the `-y` / `--no-extra-mods`
  switch.

More to come!

### NFS

I've attempted to get an NFS share to replace my SD Card. I've not had any stable success. I've since abandoned trying
to implement it.

Instead, I'm using the RTSP firmware in combination with a local SD card which records events only, and
a [Shinobi](https://shinobi.video/) server that connects to the cameras over RTSP.

The [Shinobi](https://shinobi.video/) server continuously records to an NFS share.

This workaround kinda gives me the best of both worlds.

# Dangers

## WyzeHacks

There is a great mod for Wyze cameras called [WyzeHacks](https://github.com/HclX/WyzeHacks). It's actually what inspired
this project. Unfortunately there are some incompatibilities between firmware generated by this project and the hacks in
that repository. I've bricked two cameras trying to combine the two, and have since given up on trying to make them work
together. Be advised you need to pick one or the other, and if you go with WyzeHacks ensure you have flashed a stock
firmware prior to enabling the hacks.

## You'll shoot your eye out kid!

A serious heads up! Modifying firmware and flashing modified firmware on your device can brick it. That means you could
be holding a $25 - $100 paperweight if something goes wrong!
Please consider the risks before proceeding!

**I'm NOT responsible if your device turns into an overpriced rock, lights on fire, or anything in between!**

# Pre-Built Firmware

Please build your own firmware! Since you'll need to set your own telnet password and NFS connection info, there is no
point for me to provide prebuilt firmware. Check out the section below on *Generating Your Own Firmware*.

# Generate Your Own Firmware

## Setup

I've only tested this on Ubuntu 20.

### System Prerequisites

Install the following with your package manager:

* python3
* pip
* u-boot-tools
* mtd-utils
* squashfs-tools / squashfs (macOS)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MelonSmasher/WyzeFirmwareTool.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

This program requires sudo to manage the JFFS2 image.

#### Modify a specific firmware version

Pick a version number
from [this page](https://wyzelabs.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024852172-Release-Notes-Firmware).

```bash
sudo ./wyzefwtool -f <firmware-version> --usb-ethernet --telnet-server --no-extra-mods
# E.G: sudo ./wyzefwtool -f 4.9.6.218 --usb-ethernet --telnet-server --no-extra-mods
```

#### Modify the RTSP firmware

To modify the [official RTSP firmware](https://wyzelabs.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026245231-Wyze-Cam-RTSP), run
the following:

```bash
sudo ./wyzefwtool --rtsp --usb-ethernet --telnet-server --no-extra-mods
```

#### All command options

```bash
usage: wyzefwtool [-h] [-f [FIRMWARE_VERSION]] [-r] [-u] [-d] [-t] [-n] [-y]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f [FIRMWARE_VERSION], --firmware-version [FIRMWARE_VERSION]
                        The version number of the firmware to modify
  -r, --rtsp            Download the RTSP firmware. If used the Firmware Version argument is ignored.
  -u, --usb-ethernet    Enable USB Ethernet support for ASIX based ethernet adapters.
  -d, --disable-wlan    Disabled the wifi connection. Requires that you enable USB ethernet support.
  -t, --telnet-server   Enable persistent telnet server on the camera. Requires that you set a root password.
  -y, --no-extra-mods   The tool will not wait for you to make extra custom modifications.
```
